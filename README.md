# Template Compstate

A template [compstate][compstate] for use with SRComp.

This can be used as the starting point for a new compstate using GitHub's
feature to [create a new repository from a template][repo-from-template].
This template includes many of the files which would otherwise need setting up
by hand when [preparing for a new competition][comp-prep].
